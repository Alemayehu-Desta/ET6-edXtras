# Behavior, Strategy, Implementation

Practice distinguishing & describing a program's behavior, strategy and implementation.

The examples contain commented program to study, the exercises contain uncommented programs with dummy variable names:

1. **Behavior**: Run the program to understand its _behavior_.  Write a docstring to describe the program/function's behavior then rename the file.
2. **Implementation**: Read, step through, and study the code to understand its _implementation_.
3. **Strategy**: Rename the variables and add comments (if necessary) to describe the program's _strategy_.
